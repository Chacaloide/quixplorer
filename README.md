#### 2010-05-07 - project moved to github

Since i never got warm with the user interface of sourceforge (sorry guys), i finally decided to move this project over here to github.

You'll find 2 branches at the moment:

- master - as recommended by git 
- unstable/smarty - this is the working-branch for integrating the smarty template engine
