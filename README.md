#### 2010-05-07 - using the smarty template engine

I'm currently working on the migration of the smarty template engine into quixplorer.
If done, you'll be able to define your own templates for the look and feel of quixplorer.
This will affect almost every source in the project, so the work will take some while.
However, if you want to take a first look on it and may participate on that work,
check out the unstable/smarty branch which contains the regarding changes.

I'm looking forward in getting your feedback.

#### 2010-05-07 - project moved to github

Since i never got warm with the user interface of sourceforge (sorry guys), i finally decided to move this project over here to github.

You'll find 2 branches at the moment:

- master - as recommended by git 
- unstable/smarty - this is the working-branch for integrating the smarty template engine
